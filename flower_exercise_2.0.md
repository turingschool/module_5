### Prework for Session
Session participation requires completing the following steps. Please give yourself 1-2 hours total for these exercises:

1. Please retake the Pairin survey [here](https://survey.pairin.com/signup/22142/student). Important reminders for taking the survey:
* There are 2 sections for this survey:
   * First section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you currently are_
   * Second section: Choose or de-select adjectives to answer _how you would like to be_. The second section is marked as "optional," but it is highly recommended that you fill out this section in order to provide more data for you on how you'd like to grow. 
* The survey should take you about 15-20 minutes.

2. Read through your results and use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LIR7gITKqOX2ewcOqp_KTkj3Phqjk4ZKoOrpUdidvwM/edit?usp=sharing) to help you understand what each category means. Respond to these reflection questions:
* What, if anything, was different about your top 4 qualities?
* What do these results tell you about yourself?
* Describe in your own words how you'd describe each of the following in terms of what it means for you as a software developer:
  * 1. Thinking Style (how do you think best?)
  * 2. Most Intense Driver (what drives you?)
  * 3. Top EQ Competency (how do you lead with emotional intelligence?)
  * 4. Highest Virtue Class (how does this help you manage and overcome problems? How can this virtue help you with relationships? How does this virtue help enahnce health and overall well-being?) 
  
3. Fill out [these brainstorming sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xa0mi3K1sZYXjVhwL9bLVXOuEGsvJ7RCQOoMf4MtzWs/edit?usp=sharing) for your new Junior Developer Flower.

### Session Objectives
* 

### Review of Pairin
#### What is Pairin again? 
Pairin is an assessment that measures over 100 coachable and changeable professional skills and mindsets ranging from conflict management to empathy to leadership. As we explore the Top 4 Pairin qualities again, it's important to note that the attribute in which you have the **highest intensity** in each of these 4 categories is what showed up in your results; you also utilize each of the other attributes but in lower intensities. 

#### Thinking Styles 
Pairin Thinking Styles are characteristic ways of processing information and handling tasks. This includes how people acquire knowledge, organize thoughts, form views and opinions, apply personal value, plan, decide, solve problems, and express themselves. Thinking styles are NOT the same thing as thinking ability.

The 4 Thinking Styles utilize the Jungian psychological types in which Perceiving and Judging approaches are broken down into Sensing, Intuition, Thinking, and Feeling:
* Perceiving (information-gathering)
  * Sensing (S): Focusing on what can be perceived using the 5 senses
  * Intuition (N): Focusing on perceiving patterns and interrelationships
* Judging (decision-making)
  * Thinking (T)
  * Feeling (F)

All of these functions can be either Introverted (I) or Extraverted (E) 

Our top thinking style shows our dominant approach to how we process information and handle tasks using that psychology. 

These are categorized in 4 areas:

* **Cooperative-Practical:** Conventional, structured, and contented approach that moderates thoughts and feelings
  * Reasonable, organized, systematized
  * Trusting, caring, loyal
  * Upbeat, understanding, and respectful
  * Struggle to anticipate issues or connect causes
  * High intensity attributes:
    * Supportiveness
    * Steady Optimism
    * Sociability
    * Enriching Others
  * Jungian: ST

* **Imaginative-Inspirational:** Feelings, impressions, informality, or action are emphasized more than rational evaluating
  * Adventurous, clever, skilled in social tactics
  * Enjoy lightness, five senses and festivity
  * Strong passion, impulse, and emotions
  * Favor feeling over facts, logic, or introspection
  * High intensity attributes:
    * Feeling & Impression
    * Spontaneity
    * Playfulness
    * Intense Originality
  * SF

* **Intuitive-Conceptual:** Instinct and rationale are synthesized, resulting in versatile, unconventional, and often unyielding ideas and behavior
  * Identify associations, patterns, and causes
  * Resourceful and unconventional
  * Socially uninterested
  * Convinced of their own unorthodox views
  * Fault-finding, blaming 
  * High intensity attributes:
    * Independence
    * Determination
    * Assertiveness
    * Creative/Critical Thinking
  * NT

* **Objective-Analytical:** Rational thought is emphasized more than sentiment, resulting in logical clear thinking and productivity
  * Observant, thorough, detail-oriented
  * Thoughtful and assertive
  * Value reason/rules
  * Their high value for planning and efficiency may slide to rigidity 
  * High intensity attributes: 
    * Achievement
    * Responsibility
    * Productivity
    * Persistence
    * Order & Duty
    * Rationality
  * NF

**Question for the group:**
* How are each of these strengths? What could that look like in action? 

#### Drivers 
Psychologist Henry Murray outlined a set of psychological needs that—-alone or in combination—-drive specific behaviors. Murray believed that everyone has the same set of needs but that individuals experience them in different intensities. These Drivers are based on Murray’s needs. The three domains (Love, Work & Growth) are derived from the core concepts of Abraham Maslow, Edgar Schein and James Sales. 

* **Love** — *to interact, connect with &  experience care for and from others*
   * Relationship: Friend 
   * Supportiveness: Caregiver 
   * Flamboyance: Stand-out 
   * Deference: Loyalist
   * Support-Seeking: Reliant

* **Work** — *to influence outcomes & gain mastery*
   * Achievement: Ace Achiever 
   * Personal Power: Director 
   * Persistence: Tug Boat 
   * Order: Specialist 
   * Aggressiveness: Blaze 

* **Growth** — *to be all that I can be in life; fulfilled purpose & potential*
   * Change: Transformer 
   * Independence: Maverick 
   * Perceptivity: Searcher 
   * Vitality: Enthusiast 
   * Self-Blame: Microscope 
   
**Question for the group:** 
* How are each of these strengths? What could they look like in action? 

#### Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Competencies 
The definition of Emotional Intelligence or EQ (first advanced by researchers Peter Salavoy and John Mayer, but popularized by author Daniel Goleman) is the ability to:

* Recognize, understand and manage our own emotions
* Recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others

In practical terms, developing EQ means gaining awareness that emotions drive our behavior and impact people (positively and negatively) and learning to manage those emotions — both our own and others — especially when we are under pressure. The EQ framework has four categories comprising 18 competencies that fall under 4 areas as outlined below.

* Self-Awareness 
  * Emotional Self-Awareness: Self-Attuned
  * Self-Assessment:	Self-Examiner 
  * Self-Confidence:	Self-Confident

* Self-Management 
  * Self-Control: Calm, Cool, Collected 
  * Transparency: Glass Window 
  * Achievement: Ace Achiever
  * Initiative: Self-Starter 
  * Optimism: Can Do Attitude 
  * Flexibility & Adaptability:	Elasticity

* Social Awareness 
  * Empathy: I “Get” You 
  * Organizational Awareness: Group Expert 
  * Service Orientation: At Your Service 

* Relationship Management  
  * Inspirational Leader: Inspirational Leader 
  * Influential Leader: Influential Leader
  * Enriching Others:	People Developer 
  * Change:	Transformer 
  * Conflict Management: Conflict Wrangler 
  * Cooperative-Practical: Team Player 
  
**Question for the group:**
* How are these areas of emotional intelligence strengths? What could they look like in action? 

#### Virtue Classes
Six broad virtues classifying 24 specific strengths that consistently emerge as “good” across history and culture. Pairin’s virtues map to Character Strengths and Virtues (Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P., 2004), the work of a prestigious group of researchers who have attempted to create a systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. Their aim was to present a measure of humanist ideals of virtue in an empirical and scientific way.  

Knowing your leading virtue class and associated strengths isn’t just interesting information. Research shows that tapping into character strengths can help an individual to: 1) Buffer against, manage and overcome problems, 2) Improve relationships, and 3) Enhance health and overall well-being.

* Courage: Lover of Courage 
* Humanity: Lover of Humanity 
* Justice: Lover of Justice 
* Transcendence:	Lover of Transcendence 
* Wisdom & Knowledge:	Lover of Wisdom 
* Temperance:	Lover of Moderation 

**Questions for the group:**
* How is a virtue a strength? What could that look like in action? 

#### Why is knowing this information about yourself useful? 
The results from your survey can help you identify some of your strengths and potential areas for growth so that you have language to help you:

* Answer interview questions in which you need to describe your strengths and thinking processes
* Communicate and set expectations with team members
* Structure your job search so that you're seeking out opportunities and people that will allow you to use your strengths best and thrive

### Articulating Your Strengths: What's Changed for You
With the above uses in mind, let's practice articulating your strengths in different contexts.

#### Turn/Talk (or Whole Group Sharing Out)
Respond to these questions with a partner:

* 1. (From the prework) Describe in your own words each of the following in terms of what it means for you as a software developer:
  * A. Thinking Style (how do you think best?)
    * How can you use your Top Thinking Style to structure your approach in the job search? 
  * B. Most Intense Driver (what drives you?)
    * How can you use your Top Driver to *drive* your job search?
  * C. Top EQ Competency (how do you lead with emotional intelligence?)
    * How can you use your Emotional Intelligence in your job search?  
  * D. Highest Virtue Class (how does this help you manage and overcome problems? How can this virtue help you with relationships? How does this virtue help enahnce health and overall well-being?)
    * How could you use your top Virtue Class to guide your job search? 

### Review: What is the Flower Exercise?
This is meant to help you discover your top priorities and most important guiding principles for your immediate job search and your overall career. 

The process for narrowing these pieces down is to follow these three steps:
1. Brainstorm -- *you did this in your session prework*
2. Synthesize
3. Prioritize

In order to synthesize and make sense of the information that came up for you, please review the worksheets you worked on prior to today's session.

#### Small Group Discussion: Synthesis
In your small groups, share the answers to these questions:

* Petal #1: Technology & Industries:
  * What does your brainstorming tell you about how do you prefer to approach problem-solving? 
  * What understanding do you have of the problems of your preferred industries? How could you find out more? 
* Petal #2: 
  Pairin driver prompting questions
