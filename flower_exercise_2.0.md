### Prework for Session
Session participation requires completing the following steps. Please give yourself 1-2 hours total for these exercises:

1. Please retake the Pairin survey [here](https://survey.pairin.com/signup/22142/student). Important reminders for taking the survey:
* There are 2 sections for this survey:
   * First section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you currently are_
   * Second section: Choose or de-select adjectives to answer _how you would like to be_. The second section is marked as "optional," but it is highly recommended that you fill out this section in order to provide more data for you on how you'd like to grow. 
* The survey should take you about 15-20 minutes.

2. Read through your results and use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LIR7gITKqOX2ewcOqp_KTkj3Phqjk4ZKoOrpUdidvwM/edit?usp=sharing) to help you understand what each category means. Respond to these reflection questions:
* What, if anything, was different about your top 4 qualities?
* What do these results tell you about yourself?
* Describe in your own words how you'd describe each of the following in terms of what it means for you as a software developer:
  * 1. Thinking Style (how do you think best?)
  * 2. Most Intense Driver (what drives you?)
  * 3. Top EQ Competency (how do you lead with emotional intelligence?)
  * 4. Highest Virtue Class (how does this help you manage and overcome problems? How can this virtue help you with relationships? How does this virtue help enahnce health and overall well-being?) 
  
3. Fill out [these brainstorming sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xa0mi3K1sZYXjVhwL9bLVXOuEGsvJ7RCQOoMf4MtzWs/edit?usp=sharing) for your new Junior Developer Flower.

### Session Objectives
* 

### Review of Pairin
What is Pairin again? Pairin is an assessment that measures over 100 coachable and changeable professional skills and mindsets ranging from conflict management to empathy to leadership. 

Why is this information useful? The results from your survey can help you identify some of your strengths and potential areas for growth so that you have language to help you:

* Answer interview questions in which you need to describe your strengths and thinking processes
* Communicate and set expectations with team members
* Structure your job search so that you're seeking out opportunities and people that will allow you to use your strengths best and thrive

### Articulating Your Strengths: What's Changed for You
With the above uses in mind, let's practice articulating your strengths in different contexts.

#### Turn/Talk (or Whole Group Sharing Out)
Respond to these questions with a partner:

* 1. (From the prework) Describe in your own words how you'd describe each of the following in terms of what it means for you as a software developer:
  * A. Thinking Style (how do you think best?)
  * B. Most Intense Driver (what drives you?)
  * C. Top EQ Competency (how do you lead with emotional intelligence?)
  * D. Highest Virtue Class (how does this help you manage and overcome problems? How can this virtue help you with relationships? How does this virtue help enahnce health and overall well-being?)
* 2. How have you seen yourself grow and change over the past year? 
* 3. What does this information tell you about what kind of environment and team you would thrive in?
* 4. Why will knowing all of this information help you in your job search?

Share out your response to #4 in a whip-around in the whole group.

### Review: What is the Flower Exercise?
This is meant to help you discover your top priorities and most important guiding principles for your immediate job search and your overall career. 

The process for narrowing these pieces down is to follow these three steps:
1. Brainstorm -- *you did this in your session prework*
2. Synthesize
3. Prioritize

In order to synthesize and make sense of the information that came up for you, please review the worksheets you worked on prior to today's session.

#### Small Group Discussion: Synthesis
In your small groups, share the answers to these questions:

* Petal #1: Technology & Industries:
  * What does your brainstorming tell you about how do you prefer to approach problem-solving? 
  * What understanding do you have of the problems of your preferred industries? How could you find out more? 
* Petal #2: 
  Pairin driver prompting questions
