### Prework for Session
Session participation requires completing the following steps. Please give yourself 1-2 hours total for these exercises:

1. Please retake the Pairin survey [here](https://survey.pairin.com/signup/22142/student). Important reminders for taking the survey:
* There are 2 sections for this survey:
   * First section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you currently are_
   * Second section: Choose or de-select adjectives to answer _how you would like to be_. The second section is marked as "optional," but it is highly recommended that you fill out this section in order to provide more data for you on how you'd like to grow. 
* The survey should take you about 15-20 minutes.

2. Read through your results and use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LIR7gITKqOX2ewcOqp_KTkj3Phqjk4ZKoOrpUdidvwM/edit?usp=sharing) to help you understand what each category means. Respond to these reflection questions:
* What, if anything, was different about your top 4 qualities?
* What do these results tell you about yourself?
* Describe in your own words how you'd describe each of the following in terms of what it means for you as a software developer:
  * 1. Thinking Style (how do you think best?)
  * 2. Most Intense Driver (what drives you?)
  * 3. Top EQ Competency (how do you lead with emotional intelligence?)
  * 4. Highest Virtue Class (how does this help you manage and overcome problems? How can this virtue help you with relationships? How does this virtue help enahnce health and overall well-being?) 
  
3. Fill out [these brainstorming sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xa0mi3K1sZYXjVhwL9bLVXOuEGsvJ7RCQOoMf4MtzWs/edit?usp=sharing) for your new Junior Developer Flower.
