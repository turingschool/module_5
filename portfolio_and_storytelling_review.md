# Portfolio & Storytelling Review

### Homework
  - Update profile on Turing Portfolio Site (make sure projects are up-to-date, resume is current, and all links work).
  - Revisit your personal story so that it is fresh in your mind for the session.
### Purpose
   1) In any professional engagement, be it an interview, a meetup, or a coffee meeting, you will be asked some variation of 'tell me about yourself.' As we begin mod 5 we want to make sure that you feel comfortable, confident and ready to answer tat question with aplomb.
   2) Your Turing portfolio is the primary means we use to introduce our students to employers. Help us make a good impression for you by keeping it ready to view.
